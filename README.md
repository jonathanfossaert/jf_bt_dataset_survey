# jf_bt_dataset_survey

## Introduction

This repository contains the scripts to extract specific data attributes of the datasets: KITTI, nuScenes, Waymo, Arogverse2, ONCE, and ZOD. As well as plot these to enable a visualization  of the data. 

## Dataset Labels

Please note that the dataset labels are not included in this repository due to their large size. You can download the dataset labels separately and later upload them to your workstation.

## Plot Generation Scripts

All the scripts to generate plots can be found in the `/All Datasets - Data` directory. However, keep in mind that the required `.json` files for these scripts need to be created using the extractors found in the files of the dictionaries of each dataset.

   - The labels are the annoations for the datatsets, which come in different formats. The ones i worked with i will upload to the workstation 

2. **Plot Generation:**
